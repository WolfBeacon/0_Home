##Why Open Source?

WolfBeacon is for the Hackathon community. Becoming Open-Source allows us to establish trust between the project and the developers, increase quality and efficiency of the program across all platforms and have the best talent develop the best platform!

##Our Open Source First Principles

Open-Source software is the most rewarding software since it benefits not only the users of that software but the tech community by providing useful and efficient code to share. WolfBeacon will always be open source as we believe that is the best way to build a product and a community!
